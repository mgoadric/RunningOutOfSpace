My Ludum Dare 42 entry **Baggage Claim** is complete! 

![gameplay](2018-08-1311.17.40.gif)

It's a stressful microgame where you must clear luggage as fast as you can. Each new bag must be shifted on the carousel within 5 seconds of it arriving or you run out of space and the game is over. You score for every piece you get off the carousel.
